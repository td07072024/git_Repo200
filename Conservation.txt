The giant armadillo was classified as vulnerable on the World Conservation Union's Red List in 2002, and is listed under Appendix I (threatened with extinction) of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.

The giant armadillo is protected by law in Colombia, Guyana, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Suriname and Peru,[24][25] and commercial international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).[23] However, hunting for food and sale in the black market continues to occur throughout its entire range.[23] Some populations occur in protected reserves, including the Parque das Emas in Brazil,[26] and the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, a massive 1.6-million-hectare site of pristine rainforest managed by Conservation International.[27] Such protection helps to some degree to mitigate the threat of habitat loss, but targeted conservation action is required to prevent the further decline of this species.

At least one zoo park, in Villavicencio, Colombia – Los Ocarros – is dedicated to this animal.
