Giant armadillos are solitary and nocturnal, spending the day in burrows.[6] They also burrow to escape predators, being unable to completely roll into a protective ball.[14] Compared with those of other armadillos, their burrows are unusually large, with entrances averaging 43 cm (17 in) wide, and typically opening to the west.[15]

Giant armadillos use their large front claws to dig for prey and rip open termite mounds. The diet is mainly composed of termites, although ants, worms, spiders, other invertebrates, small vertebrates and carrion are also eaten.[6][16] Little is currently known about this species' reproductive biology, and no juveniles have ever been discovered in the field.[17] The average sleep time of a captive giant armadillo is said to be 18.1 hours.[18]

Some giant armadillos have been reported to have eaten bees by digging into beehives.[19]

In a long-term study on the species, that started in 2003 in the Peruvian Amazon, dozens of other species of mammals, reptiles and birds were found using the giant armadillos' burrows on the same day, including the rare short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis). Because of this, the species is considered a habitat engineer, and the local extinction of Priodontes may have cascading effects in the mammalian community by impoverishing fossorial habitat.[20] Additionally, the giant armadillo was once key to controlling leaf cutter populations which could destroy crops, but they can also damage crops themselves when digging through soil.[21]

Female giant armadillos have two teats and have a gestational period of about five months. Evidence points to only giving birth once every three years.[citation needed][22] Little is known with certainty about their life history, although it is thought that the young are weaned by about seven to eight months of age, and that the mother periodically seals up the entrance to burrows containing younger offspring, presumably to protect them from predators. Although they have never bred in captivity, a wild-born giant armadillo at San Antonio Zoo was estimated to have been around sixteen years old when it died.
