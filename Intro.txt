The giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), colloquially tatu-canastra, tatou, ocarro or tat√∫ carreta, is the largest living species of armadillo (although their extinct relatives, the glyptodonts, were much larger). It lives in South America, ranging throughout as far south as northern Argentina.[3] This species is considered vulnerable to extinction.[1]

The giant armadillo prefers termites and some ants as prey, and often consumes the entire population of a termite mound. It also has been known to prey upon worms, larvae and larger creatures, such as spiders and snakes, and plants.[4] Some giant armadillos have been reported to have eaten bees by digging into beehives.
